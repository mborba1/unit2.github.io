    <h2>VISION</h2>
    <h5>We believe that good bread, is healthy bread. Our goal is to change the<br />
      traditional way of creating and eating bread by using local & organic<br /> ingredients. 
      We use superfoods like oats, chia seeds, spinach and almonds to<br /> make our bread the
     healthiest and must nutritious it can be.  Our bread is<br /> 100% handmade and baked in small batches. 
     We bake all of our breads in<br /> daylight, that way our employees are happy and well rested. 
     In this light,<br /> breads are always fresh and our customers get to be a part of our bread<br /> 
     making process: from making the doughs, shaping and coming fresh out of<br /> the oven. 
     We want to share our knowledge and passion with anyone and everyone<br /> who walks through our bakery doors. 
     We don’t just want to be another bakery..<br /> we want to be a part of the community, an experience and a<br /> healthier choice.</h5>

    <h5>The inspiration and passion for baking goes back to Louise’s mom in Copenhagen. Growing up in Denmark where the focus on health,<br /> 
     nutrition and well-being is an important part of life, it always came very natural for Else to apply that to almost anything in daily<br />
     life. She was a professional athlete and marathon runner in her 20s and 30s and created a healthier recipe for herself to fit her<br />
      needs. She created a bread that was filled with seeds, vegetables, organic grains and healthy fats.<br /> 
     The bread has become famous among friends and family and it’s that recipe that has made us what we are today.</h5><br />
